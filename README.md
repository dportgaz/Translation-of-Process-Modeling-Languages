# Translation-of-Process-Modeling-Languages
In regard of a bachelor thesis this projects goal is to translate a PHILhamonic Flows process model (written as a JSON file) into a process model in terms
of BPMN (written as a XML file) in order to analyze the compatibility of object-centric and activity-centric process modeling languages. Such result (i.e., XML file of 
the BPMN process model) can be used by various process modeling editors online (e.g., signavio, camunda) to provide a final BPMN process model. In this regard, the
bachelor thesis will serve as a detailed README for this project and will be provided here, as soon as the thesis is finished (approx. january 2023). Until then, if anyone
is interested in further details now or would like to see some examples of the functionality of the project, feel free to contact me.
